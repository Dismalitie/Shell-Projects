Requirements:

In order to integrate the API with your program, create a folder in your project / applications root directory called `orionAPI`. Within that folder create an output file named something relevant to your app - the reccommended is `orion_custom.txt`.

To use it, simply run the executable that is packaged in the latest version after unzipping it to `%USERPROFILE%\dismal.dev\orionAPI` and extracting the latest / wanted version.
